## Result Analysis

#### 1)How we met expected goals:



1. **Collect real-time memory usage statistics from every existed process**

   (picture)+(clarification)





2. **Rank and display memory usage statistics.**

   

3. **Detect and record memory allocation  and release status for specific processes.**

   

4. **Detect and record file handle allocation  and release status for specific processes.**

   

5. **Detect and report potential memory leak according to the tracked allocation and release information.**

   

6. **Pack the above features together as our final memory tracker.**



#### 2) More Advanced goals acheived:



#### 3) Goals that are not implemented and its difficulties:

1. Detect and alert potential memory overflow or underflow especially caused by read and write.
2. Detect and alert use on uninitialized memory.
3. Detect and alert read and write operations on memory after it has been freed.
4. Detect and alert use on memory beyond the allocated size.
5. Detect and alert invalid access to heap and stack.
